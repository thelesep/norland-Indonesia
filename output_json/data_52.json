  "Character Mood\n\nIf a lord's <b>mood</b> drops due to <b>negative thoughts</b>, they will start speaking harshly, leading to conflicts. If the situation does not improve, over time, this may result in a nervous breakdown. \n\nA good mood, on the other hand, can inspire the lord, enhance their skills, and make them more friendly.\n",
  "Character Mood\n\nThe most basic causes of negative thoughts are the lack of food and shelter, while the simplest way to improve their mood is alcohol. \n\nYou have a supply of food for now, but it is better to establish your own production.\n\nTo do this, let's learn how to construct and manage buildings, starting with builder management.\n",
  "Building Management\n\nIn Norland, you only control the lordly family, while workers need their instructions to start working.  \n\nYou must assign a managing lord to the Hall, and the Hall's servants will distribute their instructions to buildings daily. If the manager is absent, they will be replaced.  \n{split}\nLet's assign a manager to the Hall, where builders are stationed alongside the servants.  \n\n1. Select the Hall  \n2. Click the \"INSTRUCTIONS\" button in the building menu <b>at the bottom left</b>  \n3. Select a lord with the highest Management skill for the manager role.  \n4. <b>Wait</b> for the lord to issue instructions to the servants, who will then relay them to the workers.  \n",
  "Peasant Mood\n\nBy fulfilling the peasants' needs, you increase their average mood, which affects <b>migration</b>. An average mood <b>above 50</b> will attract new workers to your city. Conversely, if the average mood falls <b>below 25</b>, peasants will leave and turn to crime.  \n\nThere are many ways to boost mood, such as alcohol, temple sermons, and executions, but often the simplest way is to eliminate negative thoughts.  \n\nLet's find out what bothers them the most.  \n\n$ Hover over the peasant icon in the top left corner.  \n",
  "Books and Knowledge\n\nAt the bottom, the strongest negative thoughts of the peasants are displayed, along with the number of characters affected by them.  \n\nSo, we see that they are troubled by tasteless <b>Rutabaga</b>.  \n\nWe can establish the production of higher-quality food, but for that, we need knowledge found in books. But where can we get them?  \n\nThis is where the <b>Holy Caravan</b> comes in. And we also need <b>Gold</b>.\n",
  "Books and Knowledge\n\nThe Church maintains a natural balance of demand, so if you start selling too much of one item, its price will drop. But for now, there is a stock available.  \n\n1. Sell 30 units of your produced Moonshine  \n2. Buy the book \"Rye Field and Mill\"  \n3. Close the trade menu  \n\n$ You can move more items at once by holding {input.action.gui_add_more}.  \n",
  "Books and Knowledge\n\nNow that we have a book about growing <b>Rye</b> and producing <b>Flour</b>, it can be studied in the Library through the <b>Knowledge Menu</b>.  \n{split}\nBooks can be written in different languages, but most are in the Imperial language.  \n\n1. Open the <b>Knowledge Menu</b>  \n2. Assign a lord to study \"Rye Field and Mill\"  \n",
  "Lord's Menu\n\nIn the lord's menu, you can see their main attributes (such as <b>Mood</b> and <b>Loyalty</b>), inventory, and traits. Other tabs allow you to view their personality traits and relationships with other lords.  \n{split}\nBut right now, we can see that their mood is affected by a strong negative thought. You can hover over any icon or attribute to get more details.  \n\n$ Hover over the thought to learn more.  \n",
  "The Desire for Gold\n\nSo, he is upset about an unfulfilled desire.\n\nIf you hover over the desire icon (in the <b>Strong Feelings</b> section), you will see that this lord dreams of Gold - who doesn’t? \n{split}\nLet’s share some Gold with this lord by rewarding him, and in doing so, boost his <b>Mood</b> and improve his relations with our king.\n\n1.
