  "Character needs\n\nWhile you can only directly give orders to your lords, all characters in Norland have thoughts and needs. If these needs are not met, characters will become unhappy and start causing problems.\n\n1. Select a lord by clicking on their portrait.\n2. Click on the <b>Mood</b> tab in the <b>Character menu</b> to see their <b>thoughts and needs</b>.",
  "Food and alcohol\n\nThe most basic of needs are <b>food and rest</b>, which are replenished by consuming food and alcohol.\n\nYou have a stock of provisions for the time being, but it's necessary to ensure reliable food and alcohol production so your characters don't go hungry.\n\nTo do this, let's learn how to construct and manage buildings, starting with managing builders.",
  "Building management\n\nIn Norland, you only control the noble family, so you need to assign a manager to oversee the workers in the buildings.\n\nThe instructions given by the managing lord are sufficient for three days, and on average, one lord can manage 7-10 buildings.\n{split}\nLet's appoint a manager to the Hall, where your builders are assigned.\n\n1.

  "Alcohol\n\nGreat, we have food production sorted out. Now it's time for alcohol, that helps lift everyone's mood after a hard day's work.\n\nWe already have a built a <b>Brewery</b> for alcohol production, so let's create an order for the production of the cheapest type of alcohol, <b>Moonshine</b>, which is made from <b>Rutabaga</b>.\n\n$ Open the <b>Production</b> menu.",
  "Task creation\n\nYou can place a one-time order (<b>Make X</b>) or request ongoing support to maintain a desired level (<b>Do Until X</b>).\n\nLet's order the support for maintaining a quantity of {moonshine_goal} units of <b>Moonshine</b>.

Specify how much Moonshine you want to have in the warehouse.",
  "Done!\n\nNow it's necessary to appoint a manager in the <b>Brewery</b>, and the peasants will take <b>Rutabaga</b> from the warehouse by themselves, and at the end of the working day, they will bring the produced <b>Moonshine</b> to the warehouse.\n\nPlease note that you already have {moonshine_now} units of Moonshine, so to complete the task of producing {moonshine_goal} units of Moonshine, you will need an additional {rutabage_need} units of Rutabaga, as one unit of Rutabaga produces one unit of Moonshine.\n{split}\n1.

  "Prices and Wages\n\nOnce the workers receive instructions, they will begin their duties.\n\nDuring the day, they work, and in the evening, they tend to their own needs - receiving a <b>wage</b>, which they use to buy food and alcohol from your <b>Markets</b> and <b>Taverns</b>.\n{split}\n$ Ideally, <b>each</b> character will consume <b>one</b> unit of food and <b>one</b> unit of alcohol per day.\n$ Characters will try to purchase higher-quality goods whenever possible.\n$ Lords receive food and alcohol for free, delivered to the <b>Hall</b> by the servants who take it from the warehouse.\n\n$ Open the Finance menu.",

  "Peasants' mood\n\nBy meeting the needs of the peasants, you increase their <b>average mood</b> for the day, which affects <b>migration</b>. A high average mood will attract new workers to your city. Conversely, unhappy peasants will leave the city and become criminals.\n\nLet's find out what concerns them the most.\n\n$ Hover your mouse over the peasants' icon in the top left corner.",
  "Books and knowledge \n\nAt the bottom, the strongest negative thoughts of the peasants are written, along with the number of characters that share them.\n\nWe can see here that they are displeased by the flavorless <b>Rutabaga</b> and the unappetizing <b>Moonshine</b>. \n\nWe can resolve this by producing higher-quality products, but we can't do that without specialized knowledge contained in books. But where can we get them? \n\nAh, here comes the <b>Holy Caravan</b> to the rescue! They will sell us books and give us much-needed <b>gold<b> for our other resources.",
  "Holy Caravan\n\nGold circulates through the economy of Norland in three ways: the pockets of peasant migrants, trade with neighbors, and the Holy Caravan.\n\nThe Holy Caravan arrives in the evening every 1-3 days and is the main source of <b>Gold</b>, <b>Holy Rings</b> (a luxury appreciated by lords that serves as the currency of their class), <b>books</b>, and <b>prisoners</b>. \n{split}\n1. Wait until the Caravan arrives at its destination.\n2.

  "Buy goods\n\nThe Church supports the natural balance of supply and demand, so if you start selling too much of one product, the sale price will decrease.

  "Books\n\nNow that we have a book on how to grow Hops and produce Beer, you can study it in the Library through the Knowledge menu.\n{split}\nBooks can be written in different languages, but most are written in the Imperial language.\n\n1.

  "Knowledge\n\nIf at least one lord has read a book, the abilities and effects it enables become available to all. However, when that lord dies, all benefits of the knowledge will be lost. \n\n$ Close the Knowledge menu",
  "Tasks for lords\n\nBesides managing buildings, your lords can also carry out other tasks. However, they will refuse to do any tasks if they are unhappy.\n\nIt seems that one of them is already unhappy now - this is indicated by the red background in their portrait.\n\nLet's see what happened.\n\n$ Select the unhappy lord by clicking on their portrait at the top or finding the lord on the map.",

  "Mood of lords\n\nHere you can see a lord's needs and thoughts, the sum of which determines their mood. If it's below 25, they are unhappy.\n\nThoughts can arise from needs or as a reaction to certain events.\n\nHover over a thought to learn more details.",

  "Actions on the map \n\nThe <b>Gold</b> you rewarded the lord with cannot be produced; it can only be acquired through trade.. And since selling large volumes of goods lowers prices with the caravan, sometimes it makes sense to trade with neighbors, where prices remain more stable.",
  "Relations with neighbors\n\nTo enter into a trade contract, you must either be in the same state as your neighbor or have good relations with them.\n\nThere are many ways to establish friendship with a neighboring king - give him a gift, send your lord on a mission, or simply send your king to hunt together with him.",
  "Relations with neighbors\n\nNow let's improve the neighboring king's attitude toward yours so we can then set up a trade deal with them.\n\n1.

  "The Moonshine will be delivered soon!\n\nFor the trade to take place, an available peasant from your city will be dispatched to the target city.
