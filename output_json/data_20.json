["~\r\nBandits from your provinces are attacking my villages and terrorizing the peasants. I am surrounded by enemies, and I have neither the time nor the desire to deal with this scum. I implore you to handle them swiftly.","~\r\nBandits from your provinces do not allow my peasants to live in peace. They rob and kill, sparing neither women nor children. It's time for you to deal with them, and if you ignore my request, it will be on your own conscience!","~\r\nI seldom seek assistance, as I consider it a sign of weakness. However, a serious conflict has arisen with our neighbor. So, I ask you to take my side and come to my aid. I won't forget this favor, I promise.","~\r\nI prefer to resolve disputes peacefully, but others choose the path of discord. I need your support in the conflict with our neighbor. I hope I can count on you.","~\r\nYour vassal {soul_uuid_target} is my enemy, and I refrain from attacking him solely because of you. I hope our relationship means more to you than the coins he pays you. End your vassalage with him!","~\r\nTerminate your vassalage with {soul_uuid_target}. He believes he is protected by you and takes advantage of it. Many of his actions are unjustifiable. I value our relationship, believe me, but I won't let him go unpunished!","Postscript: I extend my heartfelt condolences for your loss.","Postscript: Congratulations on your wedding! When we meet, I hope you'll treat me to a glass of beer!","Postscript: I remembered how we used to hunt in the woods. It was so much fun! At one point, my whole life flashed before my eyes!","Postscript: Please convey my deepest regards to {soul_uuid_target}. I hope he won't stay abroad for too long. His loved ones miss him dearly.","Postscript: I heard about that battle. I'm sorry. Don't give up, as we've all endured defeats.","Postscript: Remember how I emptied your pockets when we were playing dice? Perhaps we could have another match when the opportunity arises!","Postscript: I'll never forget how we won that battle against our neighbor! Now, that was a victory!","Postscript: By the way, the goods you sent me were excellent. Thank you my friend!","Postscript: Your former lord {soul_uuid_target} sends word that he's immensely glad to be rid of you. What did you do to upset him so much?","Postscript: I've been informed that you've had a child. {soul_uuid_target} is an excellent name! May Holy Sophia bless him!","Postscript: I heard about your victory. Accept my congratulations! It was quite impressive, as I've heard.","Postscript: Nothing fills me with as much pride as meeting the king of such a prestigious family!","Postscript: Do you remember how I collapsed on the floor after our wild revelry? My wife still reminds me of that.","Postscript: And thank you for the help you provided me! It came in very handy!","Postscript: And convey to {soul_uuid_target} that I remember everything! Betrayal is not forgotten!","Postscript: Nothing warms my heart like the memory of your shameful defeat at the hands of my sword! When I'm feeling down, I recall that moment.","Postscript: How I laughed when I heard about how you lost that battle! On that day, all my peasants drank free ale. Truly, Sophia is just.","Postscript: Do you remember how you backed out and refused to face me? Believe me, all the neighbors heard about it! Among us, there has never been such a foolish and cowardly king.","Postscript: How you amused me when I found out you couldn't even defend your own village! I wonder what your peasants think of your rule?","Postscript: I bet you have trouble sleeping after such a shameful defeat! Honestly, I thought your opponent didn't stand a chance. Thank Mother Sophia I was wrong!","Postscript: It's strange to hear about your victory. What did you bribe Mother Sophia with? She must be helping you somehow.","Postscript: It's amazing you didn't become a vassal sooner! Perhaps only rats run around in your empty chests and barracks? Well, obedience is the lot of the weak.","Postscript: I've heard they call you the most worthless lord in our region? Not surprising. Maybe you spend your nights in the barn?","Postscript: Do you think I'll forget how you betrayed me? I pray to the Holy Mother that you don't die before I have the chance to seek revenge on you!","The bones foretold a disaster. The invisible moon will rise, and blood will freeze from the hungry howl of the fleshwolf! Beware of wild beasts, and be prepared for their attack, for it won't be long now!","I saw a red glow at sunset. It's the color of blood! I threw the bones, and they told me that those who are afraid of their death will seek others at your home.","I had a prophetic dream last night. Instead of green crops, I saw black ravens. They are the harbingers of hunger and death, coming to your home!","The other day we made a sacrifice, and the blood of the slaughtered calf did not spray in a crimson stream; a foul-smelling black liquid flowed from it. Diseases will come to your settlements soon!","The sacred text opened on a page where people throw themselves at each other like wild beasts, and the cries of children are heard from the flames of fire. Holy Sophia warns you!","Last night I had a dream. A shadow in a hood leaned over me. A dagger flashed in her hand. Beware of vagabonds; I am sure it's a sign from above!","The seers say they saw in the clouds mad people standing with burning crosses in their hands. There are many of them, and rage fills their hearts!","The moon does not rise for ten days in a row. The ancient books say this is a harbinger of crop failure and hunger. May Holy Sophia help you!","I had a bad dream. Dark trunks of leafless trees like motionless statues stood instead of your green forests. I hope you know what to do!","In nectar oblivion, I had a vision. On the altar, I saw a rat devouring the flesh of a newly born lamb. I foretell hunger and troubles in your kingdom!","Our caravaneers say that the black shadow of calamity has receded. I hope all your loved ones are alive and well. But I'm afraid this is not the last trial that Mother Sophia sends us for our sins.","With tenderness in my heart,\r\nMatriarch","Verily, a favorable outcome, I must confess, I did not anticipate. Yet, I am exceedingly glad that our enmity lies in the past. What is past is to be forgotten, is it not so?","Your efforts to restore peace between our kingdoms, I must acknowledge, I esteem. However, the nobility of your deed does not entail my trust henceforth.","Know that I am no longer inclined to submit to you. And if you seek the reason for my disobedience, look in the mirror. In my hour of need, I received no aid from you. Henceforth, your kingdom is diminished.","The vow of military assistance was given by you when I agreed to become your vassal. And what in return? The tribute appointed by you, I faithfully paid, yet in a dire moment, you abandoned me. Henceforth, I am not your vassal.","We regret that your pride has led you to such blasphemy that you decided to destroy the divine order of the world established by Mother Sophia herself. Unfortunately, admonitions are useless here. The Strict Father and his fellow inquisitors are preparing to set out. May Sophia forgive you!","Beloved Child!","Our hearts fill with joy as we, the Loving Family, watch your political successes. Just yesterday, your dynasty was weeding rutabaga, and now you are the head of state, dictating your will to your neighbors! Therefore, I am confident that our initiative to slightly increase the tax on your warriors will not be an unbearable burden for you!","Due to your entry into the greater political arena and increased influence, the Loving Family believes you should contribute more for the security of the roads.\r\n\r\nThe Church is increasing the tax on warriors, which will now be {new_tax} per unit of combat skill for each warrior (previously {old_tax}).","Peasants","Unholy Horde","Forest bandits","Mercenaries","Fleshwolves","Inquisition","Holy Caravan","Slaves of the Holy Caravan","Free lords","Loving Family","Rebellious fanatics","Rebellious slaves","Rebellious soldiers","Separatists","Marauders","Hired bandits","Abandoned Settlement","Renegades","Silverhaven","Dust Valley","Windpeak","Starstream","Moonlake","Sparksville","Crystallight","Stardale","Enchantment","Treewood","Moonrealm","Greatmist","Brightvale","Misthaven","Goldshire","Sparkfall","Lakehold","Dragonhorn","Greenspire","Twilighton","Crystallia","Wonderlore","Frostkeep","Beastwood","Wave Market","Overgrowth","Fairytale Glen","Icy Gorge","Darkwood","Mirror Pond","Twilight Fortress","Dreamfall"]
