  "~\nYou have freed me from paying such an unimaginable tribute; may Holy Sophia reward you for this! I realize that your army has suffered significant losses, but rest assured, I will not leave this debt unpaid!",
  "~\nI see you are in dire need of sworn enemies! Did you truly believe that you could shield this wretch from my vassal authority? Your failure will serve as a stark reminder to others that standing against me is the epitome of foolishness!",
