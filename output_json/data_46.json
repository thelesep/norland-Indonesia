  "Cult of Dahamat\nDahamat is an ancient fertility goddess of the Makha people, who was displaced by the cult of Mother Sophia during early imperial times.\n\nAlthough the sacred groves and ancient altars of Dahamat were desecrated and replaced by temples of Mother Sophia, the priests of Dahamat were not completely eradicated. They transformed their cult into a secret, highly exclusive society. While Mother Sophia inherited many traits of the old Dahamat, the later cult of the old goddess took on more sinister features, allowing its followers to survive until recent times.\n\nThe cult priests, in particular, possess the ability to secretly kill anyone, whether a lord or King, anywhere in Norland. Ignorant rumors attribute a supernatural nature to this skill, while more enlightened lords speak of their centuries-honed acting skills. They mimic anyone, mastering accents, gestures, and clothing, enabling the cult’s assassins to infiltrate the most secure places and use an ancient poison that leaves no trace.\n\nCult priests often visit cities, offering their services in exchange for the firstborns of noble Kings, who are then raised in their religion.\n\nThe actual whereabouts of the Dahamat priests remain a mystery, despite the Holy Inquisition's interest, possibly due to some Kings' reluctance to engage in conflict with the cult.",
