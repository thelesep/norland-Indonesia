  "Cainism\nA heretical doctrine from the late era of the <hint=hint_crimson_empire>Crimson Empire</hint>.\n\nWhile the teachings of Mother Sophia consider her brother Cain as the first murderer and an evil antagonist against her benevolence, Cainists claim instead that Cain was the benevolent god, who stood against Sophia's dominion and perished at her hands while defending humanity from her oppression.\n\nCainists consider the strength of human will as the primary virtue and reject many of the moral norms of Mother Sophia's teachings.\n\nOriginating on the outskirts of the Crimson Empire, Cainism was spread by <hint=hinr_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, who claimed to have received revelations from the dead god Cain and wrote the <hint=hint_secret_book_of_dead>Secret Book of the Dead</hint>.

  "The Secret Book of the Dead\nThis book, written by <hint=hinr_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, comprises the primary doctrine of Cainism.\n\nIt claims that Mother Sophia is an evil goddess who keeps humans enslaved. Her brother Cain once challenged her to free humanity, but she killed him. However, in death, Cain found freedom in the Velvet Darkness, from whence he revealed himself to Michael and instructed him to record his words and reveal them to the people.\n\nThe book asserts that the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church of Mother Sophia</hint> controls people with its doctrine of submission and its <hint=hint_sofia_truth>prohibition on stone structures</hint> higher than knee-level. Cainists believe this allows the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint> to be completely invulnerable in Norland's only stone fortress, the <hint=hint_faith_stone>Stone of Faith</hint>, and at any moment, they can annihilate any settlement that falls out of favor, and when the <hint=hint_sofia_great_purification>Great Purification</hint> comes, expedited by the prohibition against independent fortification, the Church holds all the power and preserves those who will continue to support its domination.\n\nCainists believe the only way to end the <hint=hint_great_cycle>Great Cycle</hint> is by rebelling against Mother Sophia.",
  "The Heresy of the Dead God\nThe later teachings of <hint=hint_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, which were adapted for the pagan tribes of the northern forests and develops his cult to an extreme form. It is the religion adhered to by <hint=hint_unholy_horde>the Unholy Horde</hint>.\n\nThis contradicts traditional Cainism, as it preaches the very death of civilization that Cainism sought to prevent.\n\nAccording to the doctrine, the Velvet Darkness into which Cain fell after his death at the hand of Mother Sophia is a space of tranquility and will, the only place beyond the control of this rigid goddess. To be free from the endless cycles of rebirth in this world of suffering, the human soul must go there.\n\nThis can be done by calling upon the Dead God Cain at the moment of death. Thus, proper death is seen as a gift of liberation to be sought. \n\nAdepts of this cult practice human sacrifice and ritual suicide. The \"proper\" killing of infidels is considered a special virtue, as it signifies the salvation of the soul from under the power of Sophia. The men and women of the Horde are all strong warriors trained from childhood who are not afraid to die. This makes the raids of the Unholy Horde, which are religious feats for the cultists, especially dangerous.\n\nDuring their raids, they not only kill everyone and burn cities but also make a special effort to destroy books that they consider abominations, which they believe the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church</hint> uses to control people.\n\nAdherents wear masks that help them deal with excessive emotions and attachments.",

  "War of Sacred Flame\nA war between the Church of Mother Sophia and the heretical Cainite sect that took place from 2652 to 2692.\n\nThe Church and the Emperor turned a blind eye to the <hint=hint_cainism>Cainite heresy</hint> for a long time after it first emerged in the cities of the <hint=hint_culture_makha>Makha</hint>.

The empire was on the brink of complete chaos and destruction when the <hint=hint_ieremia>Matriarch Jadwiga</hint> ascended to the Crimson Throne. Seeking an end to the war, she promised amnesty and independence to the rebellious provinces in exchange for access to their cities by the Holy Inquisition and proposed a new structure for the region's monarchies.
