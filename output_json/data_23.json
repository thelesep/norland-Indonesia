  "Ambitions\nEvery king has ambitions. If they are not pursued, over time the king will begin to feel like a failure. However, achieving them provides a strong morale boost.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_ambitions></img>\n\n$ If you have chosen ambitions in the field of production, you need to study knowledge and build more complex buildings to produce expensive goods.\n$ Ambitions in the population sphere are achieved by satisfying the needs of peasants - housing, good food, and good alcohol.\n$ Political ambitions are achieved by creating states headed by your king. Click on a city on the global map, and look in the Politics section to find out what is needed to either vassalize this province and annex them to your kingdom or create an alliance with it.",
  "Soil Fertility\nInitially, the map on which your city is located is in ecological balance. However, cutting down trees to less than {fertility_threshold}% of their original number leads to a decrease in soil fertility, as trees protect the soil from erosion. This, in turn, reduces the productivity of fields and the gathering of forest herbs.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_fertility></img>\n\nThe forest has the ability to regenerate - new trees appear next to others, thus the larger the forest area, the faster it will recover.\n\nHowever, as your city grows, you will have to make a choice between the fertility of the fields and intensive logging, compensating for the lack of another resource through external trade.\n\nYou can see the current level of deforestation and soil fertility in the <hint=hint_statistic_menu>Statistics menu</hint>.",
  "Iron Reserves\n<hint=hint_resource_iron>Iron</hint> reserves in <hint=hint_bld_mine>Mines</hint> are not infinite. Each level of Mine improvement gives you access to a limited supply of Iron, and the cost increases from level to level as miners have to dig deeper into the earth.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_iron_depleted></img>\n\nAfter depleting the resource at level 3, the Mine is completely exhausted, and your only source of Iron will be trade.\n\nYou can see how much Iron is left in the <hint=hint_statistic_menu>Statistics menu</hint> and in the Mine menu.",

  "Foreign Trade\nTrading with a caravan has its limitations, so you can always trade with neighbors on the map by signing contracts (lasting 10 days) in the neighboring province menu.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_external_trade></img>\n\n$ To start trading, it is required that relations with your ruler are either not <red>negative</red> or that you are part of the same <b>free cities alliance</b>.\n$ To set up the most beneficial contract, you should select the lord who has the highest <hint=hint_skill_negotiations>Trade</hint> skill - but be aware that you will be dealing with a lord of the same caliber on the other side.\n$ There are only a few provinces on the map that sell the scarce <hint=hint_resource_iron>Iron</hint>.\n$ If the supply of provinces remains stable and includes basic resources, then demand changes from time to time—for example, when the province grows.\n$ The trade volume increases with the population of the province and decreases if villages are plundered.\n$ Foreign trade does not <hint=hint_trade_dynamic_prices>saturate</hint> the market with goods, so you can sell as much as you like.\n$ All trades are displayed in the foreign trade menu at the bottom of the screen. You can enable daily automatic trades there.",
  "Tax on warriors\nThe Church levies taxes on your army and uses these funds to maintain the safety of the roads, allowing lords to travel between cities without fear of bandit attacks.\n\n<img=hint_sodiers_happiness></img>\n\n$ The tax depends on the total combat skill of your warriors.\n$ The tax is calculated daily, accumulating until the arrival of the <hint=hint_holy_caravan>Holy Caravan</hint>.\n$ The amount taxed for each warrior is determined by their combat skill <b>at the time of recruitment</b> and does not increase as their skill grows.\n$ The Matriarch may raise the tax if your <hint=hint_tutorial_states>state</hint> grows significantly.\n$ You can see the current army tax in the tooltip for the Army icon in the top left corner.\n\n<b>Hint:</b> If your finances are unstable, it is best to hire relatively weak warriors and then train them at the <hint=hint_bld_training_ground>Training Ground</hint>. As their combat skill increases, the tax on them will not rise.",
  "Coronation of the Emperor\nWhen your state reaches the size of 12 provinces, you can declare your king as the emperor.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_emperor></img>\n\nTo do this, select the Coronation of the Emperor in your king's menu. This action will challenge the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint>, and within a few days, you can expect a squad of <hint=hint_inqusitors>Inquisitors</hint> to attempt to burn your province to the ground.\n\nAdditionally, after the ceremony, all your subjects will experience a strong negative thought due to fear of the church. However, some population groups will be better protected from this effect:\n$ <hint=hint_persons_agnostic>Agnostics</hint> do not strongly believe in Sophia, and their negative thought will be only half as strong as normal.\n$ <hint=hint_loyalist>Loyalists</hint> blindly believe in the new Emperor, so their fear will be five times weaker.\n$ <hint=hint_persons_fanatic>Fanatics</hint>, provided the king received a blessing, will consider him the new prophet and even gain a positive thought.\n$ <hint=hint_addict>Nectar-dependents</hint> are less susceptible to such thoughts, as the pleasure derived from Nectar outweighs their sense of fear.\n\nThis is the final challenge in the game, after which there is no return. You will either defeat the punitive squad of Inquisitors and win the game, or you will lose. In any case, the game will end.",
  "Knights\n[hint_knight]",
  "Composite Squads\nYou can send two or more squads at once to attack a target on the world map.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_two_squads></img>\n\nTo do this, create the squads and check the ones you want to send before dispatching.\n\nThese squads will travel together and participate in the battle as separate units. This way, the second squad can attack the enemy archers while your first squad fights the infantry.\n\n<b>Hint:</b> To avoid risking your lords, hire <hint=hint_knight>knights</hint> in the Army menu.",
  "Inspiration\nIf a lord wakes up in a happy mood (above 80%), there is a {chance}% chance that they will gain the state of Inspiration (wing icon).\n\n<img=hint_inspiration></img>\n\nIn this state, all skills are greatly increased, making it an ideal time to use the lord for activities such as trade negotiations or combat actions.\n\nInspiration lasts for one day and disappears when the character goes to sleep. It can also vanish if the character's mood becomes unhappy.",
  "Part of the State\nSometimes when you need to gather strength and there are strong enemies nearby, it makes sense not to create your own State but to join an existing one.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_in_state></img>\n\n$ You can request to join the Free Cities Alliance through the main province action menu (icon with wings). Within the alliance, you will ensure your protection, increase <hint=hint_market_volume>local demand</hint>, and be able to trade with its members. The only obligation is to maintain good relations with the head of the alliance and to send troops when another member needs protection.\n$ When you are coerced into vassalage, it makes sense to consider your options. You will pay tribute to your suzerain, but you can save on your army, as your suzerain will have to protect you. Besides, <hint=hint_market_volume>local demand</hint> will also increase (however, there is no free trade option within vassal kingdoms).\n\nOf course, being part of another State takes you further from the ultimate goal of the game—to unite the provinces of Norland and become Emperor. But in certain situations, this option can be a lifesaver and a necessary respite.",
  "Hunting\nTo improve relationships, you can ask lords to spend time together. However, if a lord's <hint=hint_skill_manners>Manners</hint> are lacking, a joint hunt might be the better option.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_hunt></img>\n\n$ During the hunt, two lords will find and attack a <hint=hint_fleshwolf>fleshwolf</hint>. This carries the risk of injury, but you will get some excellent <hint=hint_resource_meat>Meat</hint>.\n$ The mutual positive thought after the hunt is strong and long-lasting. Additionally, after the fleshwolf is defeated, the hunters will have a <hint=hint_conversation>deep conversation</hint> - not always pleasant.\n$ Hunting is a good tool to build relationships on the world map. You can send any of your lords to hunt with any lord living in another city - for example, to win the favor of a merchant lord or the king's spouse, whose opinion also matters.",
  "Direct Orders\nBy clicking on the icon in the to-do list at the top of the character menu, you can command the lord to immediately undertake a necessary task.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_orders></img>\n\nUsually, lords decide for themselves when to do what, but sometimes you can order him to attend to a task immediately if there is an urgent need.\n\n$ At the beginning of the to-do list, the tasks you assigned to him are displayed.\n$ When a lord's need starts to bother him, tasks to address these needs also appear there. Click on the icon to make him drop everything and go fulfill that need.",
  "Passing the Crown\nWhen your ruler has too many enemies, you can always pass the crown to someone else.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_pass_crown></img>\n\nSince relations with neighbors and the matriarch are personal relationships with your monarch, you can reset them by passing the crown.\n\nThis will cause significant friction between the former and new ruler, but all external relations will now be established from scratch.",
  "Relations Tab\nTo see what characters think of each other, go to the relations tab in the character menu.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_relations_tab></img>\n\n$ Hover over any character's portrait to see which <hint=hint_thought_social>social thoughts</hint> contribute to their <hint=hint_relations>relationship</hint> with them.\n$ Factors influencing <hint=hint_interest>interest</hint> are also described there.\n$ At the top, there are relationship filters - for example, you can view relationships with characters from other noble houses or relationships between kings.\n$ You can also see relationships with important characters by hovering over their portrait on the main tab.",
  "Hate\nWhen one character’s relationship with another falls below <red>-25</red>, they start to feel hatred. This may end in murder, leaving you with one corpse and one criminal hated by the entire family.\n\n<img=hint_tutorial_hate></img>\n\n$ <hint=hint_tutorial_relations_tab>Check the social thoughts</hint> that led to the hatred. For instance, if one lord envies another for having many <hint=hint_resource_rune>Holy Rings</hint>, you can reward the first one or take away some rings from the other to reduce the difference.\n$ If you can catch this lord in a good mood, use that moment to invite them to spend time or go hunting with their rival. If one of them is not too angry with the other, they might reconcile.\n$ Try scheduling lessons for them. The student will gradually improve their attitude towards the teacher.\n$ In extreme cases, you can arrange a <hint=hint_duel>duel</hint>. Duels can result in the death of either combatant, but even if both lords survive, the desire to kill will be removed when the duel is over.\n$ And in case your lord is hated by the <hint=hint_bishop>Bishop</hint>, the lord can always <b>beg for forgiveness</b>.",
