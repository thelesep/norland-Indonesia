hint_relations,"Relationships
Relationships between characters are measured on a scale from <red>-100<red> to <green>+100</green> and can change as a result of <hint=hint_thought_social>social thoughts</hint> and <hint=hint_conversation>deep conversations</hint>.

$ Relationships above <green>+{rel_friend}</green> are considered to be <hint=hint_friendship>friends</hint>.

Social thoughts weaken over time."
hint_friendship,"Friendship
When the mutual <hint=hint_relations>relationships</hint> between characters exceed {rel_friend}, they become friends.

They are inclined to <hint=hint_action_task_together>spend time together</hint>, visit each other during <hint=hint_sick>illness</hint>, and stand up for each other in fights."
hint_interest,"Interest
Characters are drawn to each other with varying degrees of strength, which is reflected in their level of interest.

You can see their interest in the relationships tab of the Character menu when hovering over the portrait of another character.

$ Alcohol consumption
...and several other factors that can be explored by hovering over the question mark next to the interest indicator."
hint_enemy,"Enmity
If a character's attitude toward another character falls below <red>{rel_enemy}</red>, they are considered enemies. This affects their <hint=hint_interest>interest</hint>, choice of target for <hint=hint_speech_intrigue>intrigues</hint>, and preference for <hint=hint_conversation>deep conversations</hint> involving <hint=hint_speech_ignore>disregard</hint> and <hint=hint_speech_insult>insults</hint>."

Infatuation can occur when there is a high need for <hint=hint_need_sex>sex</hint> and sufficient <hint=hint_interest>interest</hint>.

Over time, infatuation may fade."
hint_flirt,"Flirting
When the <hint=hint_need_sex>Need for sex</hint> is low, the character will try to flirt by inviting those they have a <b>high</b> <hint=hint_interest>interest</hint> in for a <hint=hint_date>date</hint>.

For a date to occur, the interest in the character must be above <green>{interest_high}</green>."
hint_love_relations,"Love Relationships
If characters have had a couple of <hint=hint_date>dates</hint> in a short period of time or they are mutually in love, they become lovers.

In this case:
$ They easily engage in sexual activities with each other, without any conditions.
$ They try to <hint=hint_action_task_together>spend time together</hint>.
$ <hint=hint_relations>Relations</hint> between them become <hint=hint_relatives>family-like</hint>.
$ They <hint=hint_jealousy>feel jealousy</hint> toward each other and perceive infidelity as painful.
$ <hint=hint_speech_friendly>Emotional communication</hint> partly compensates for the <hint=hint_need_sex>need for sex</hint>.

If the attitude of one of them toward the other drops below 0, the love relationship ends."
hint_jealousy,"Jealousy
A <hint=hint_thought_social>social thought</hint> directed toward potential rivals that is experienced by individuals who are <hint=hint_love>in love</hint> or in a <hint=hint_love_relations>romantic relationship</hint>.

Rivals are considered to be all characters of the opposite gender with whom their love interest has a good relationship, as well as other individuals who are also in love with their love interest."
hint_date,"Date
Characters who have engaged in successful <hint=hint_flirt>flirting</hint> may arrange a date, in which they will meet at one of their homes to engage in sexual activity, fulfilling their need for <hint=hint_need_sex>sex</hint>.

hint_sex_bribe,"Proposition
When the need for <hint=hint_need_sex>sex</hint> is high, a character may attempt to bribe someone of the opposite gender to engage in sexual activity with them.

<img=hint_culture></img>

Cultures have an impact on various aspects of the game.
$ <b>Xenophobia</b>: Characters do not like those outside their own culture, and in the event of a massacre, they will attack them.
$ <b>Values</b>: Characters will react to your kingdom's actions and policies based on their culture's established values, indirectly influencing politics. These cultural values also affect relationships with neighboring kings, depending on their policies.
$ <b>Languages and Knowledge</b>: Each culture has its own language and a certain number of <hint=hint_book>books</hint> written in it. Caravans bring these books if there are lords in the city who can read them.
$ <b>Relationships with <hint=hint_sofia_cult>the Church</hint></b> can be influenced by a character's culture.
"
hint_title,"Title
It is a well-known fact that two hundred years ago, when the <hint=hint_сhartia_humility>Charter of Humility</hint> was signed, thus ending the <hint=hint_fire_war>War of the Sacred Flame</hint>, the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint> not only granted independence to all noble houses of Norland but also limited the number of noble titles available to each family.

<img=hint_title></img>

When your child grows up, they become a <hint=hint_untitled_lord>lesser lord</hint>, and you will need to determine their fate.

The King can also strip characters of titles, thus making them lesser lords as well. <b>These actions are available in the characters menu, under the ""King"" section.</b>

<b>HINT:</b> Your King can grant titles to <b>lesser lords and hired free lords</b> to make them part of the noble family."
hint_free_lord,"Free Lord
This lord can be assigned the same tasks as your own lords - inspect buildings, lead squads, and so on.

$ The contract will end in {day} days."
hint_bishop,"Bishop
When the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint> considers your settlement big enough, they send a bishop to you.

<img=hint_bishop></img>

$ Using the action button on Character menus, your lords can confess to the bishop to remove their <hint=hint_sin>sins</hint> as well as perform other religious actions.
$ The bishop can provoke a <hint=hint_pogrom>religious uprising</hint> if he quarrels with any of your lords. Be sure to please him.
$ The <hint=hint_relations_matriarch>Matriarch</hint> places great weight on your local Bishop's opinion about your king.
$ If the Bishop dies an unnatural death, your relations with the Matriarch will deteriorate by <red>{kill_bishop_penalty}</red>."
hint_marriage,"Marriage
The purpose of marriage is to have children, and characters strive to fulfill their duty, at least once every 1-3 days."
hint_loyalty,"Loyalty
Indicates how loyal the lord is toward the <hint=hint_persons_king>king</hint>.

<img=hint_loyalty></img>

$ Changes slightly every day, but will drop significantly if the character is <hint=hint_unhappy>unhappy</hint> or doesn't like the king.
$ High loyalty allows giving special assignments to this lord.
$ Low loyalty (below 25) can lead the lord to move to another noble house or, if they are the heir, raise a <hint=hint_nt_heir_rebellion>rebellion</hint>.

Loyalty is displayed in the Character menu. Hover your mouse cursor over the loyalty number next to the crown icon to find out how and why it has changed recently.

<b>Hint:</b> You can quickly raise loyalty by rewarding a lord or threatening them (under ""King's Actions"")."
hint_loyalty_captive,"Hostage's Loyalty
Initially, the hostage's loyalty is negative, but if you can make it positive, they will agree to become a member of your noble family."
hint_thought,"Thought
Thoughts arise from <hint=hint_needs>needs</hint> or as a reaction to situations the character finds themselves in.

The sum of thoughts affects the <hint=hint_mood>mood</hint>.

Thoughts are displayed on the mood tab of the Character menu."
hint_mood,"Mood
Measured from 0 to 100 and determined by the sum of <hint=hint_thought>thoughts</hint>.

<img=hint_mood></img>

$ Thoughts depend on the character's needs and are also reactions to events happening around them.
If the mood drops below 25, the character becomes <hint=hint_unhappy>unhappy</hint>, and if it rises above 80, the character becomes <hint=hint_happy>happy</hint>.
$ The average mood level of peasants affects the level of <hint=hint_migration>migration</hint>.

A happy lord might experience an <hint=hint_insight>insight</hint>."
hint_casus_beli,"Casus Belli
A pretext for war.

With a casus belli, you can declare war, and your relationships with other kings and the <hint=hint_synode>Holy Synod</hint> will not be harmed."
hint_terror,"Terror
Unjustified executions and punishments cause a sense of terror among the population.

<img=hint_terror></img>

Since characters of different social classes usually do not communicate with each other, <hint=hint_terror_peasants>terror among the peasants</hint> usually does not cause fear among the lords, and <hint=hint_terror_lord>terror among the lords</hint> goes unnoticed by the peasants.

You can also carry out <hint=hint_nt_terror_culture>terror against a specific culture</hint> if they threaten you with rebellion - and this will inspire the culture that hates them (for example, the Kaiden peasants will be pleased with terror against the Varn).

<b>Hint:</b> The positive thought from terrorizing a hated culture is so strong that this action is one of the best tools for creating <hint=hint_loyalist>loyalists</hint>."
hint_terror_lord,"Terror Among Lords
Some of your actions, such as unjustified executions, will terrify the lords. However, execution during a <hint=hint_pogrom>religious uprising</hint> is not considered terror.

Effects:
$ Lords experience a strong negative <hint=hint_thought>thought</hint>.
$ <hint=hint_loyalty>Loyalty</hint> increases by 40.
$ Lasts 5 days."
hint_terror_peasants,"Population Terror
When the <hint=hint_bld_scafod>Scaffold</hint> is assigned to state terror, executioners begin to undertake, without evidence, the punishment of various individuals, starting with all <hint=hint_persons_criminal>vagabonds</hint>, then the unemployed, and finally ordinary peasants.

Effects:
$ A strong negative <hint=hint_thought>thought</hint> affects 3 acquaintances of the punished character.
$ The average happiness and <hint=hint_migration>migration</hint> will decrease.
$ Unhappy <hint=hint_persons_peasant>peasants</hint> will not become <hint=hint_persons_criminal>vagabonds</hint>, and vagabonds will not become cutthroats.

You can also execute a specific peasant or vagabond through their action menu - this will also be considered to be terror."
hint_salary,"Wages
Set in the <hint=hint_finance_menu>Economy Menu</hint>. Requires knowledge of <b>Wages</b> and <b>Internal Trade</b>.

<img=hint_salary></img>

Instead of directly distributing resources, after studying the relevant knowledge, you can distribute <hint=hint_resource_gold>Gold</hint> to your subjects as wages.

$ This allows for more precise and even distribution of scarce goods among them, as expensive purchases will be made as funds accumulate.
$ Additionally, an excess of money leads to <hint=hint_rich>wealth</hint>."
hint_rich,"Wealth
If the character has eaten, had at least one drink with <hint=hint_alcohol>alcohol</hint>, and has owned a house for at least 3 days, they begin to feel prosperous, which grants a positive <hint=hint_thought>thought</hint>.

<img=hint_rich></img>

The character also feels happier if they have a lot of <hint=hint_resource_gold>Gold</hint> in their inventory. The amount differs for peasants, lords, and warriors, but it's the amount that gives them confidence in tomorrow."
hint_price,"Prices
You can set any prices at local <hint=hint_bld_market>Markets</hint> and <hint=hint_bld_tavern>Taverns</hint>.

However, if they are too high compared to the prices of the <hint=hint_holy_caravan>Holy Caravan</hint>, peasants will try to wait and buy goods from the caravan rather than from you."
hint_migration,"Migration
The number of new peasants arriving each day mainly depends on the average <hint=hint_nt_unhappy>mood</hint> of the peasants in the city.

<img=hint_migration></img>

Depending on the average mood:

$ Below <red>{gone_tres}</red>: peasants will start leaving your city.
$ For every {mood_step} mood points above this, +{migrant} migrant will arrive (for example, if the mood is between {tres_3} and {tres_4}, {mig_number} migrants will arrive).

<b>Hints:</b>
$ You can check the expected number of migrants by hovering over the peasant icon in the top left.
$ Additionally, new settlers bring along the <hint=hint_resource_gold>gold</hint> they accumulated in their previous location.
$ A war in a neighboring province increases migration.
$ Migration is also reduced by <hint=hint_terror_peasants>terror</hint>"
hint_betrayal,"Betrayal
If your lord's <hint=hint_loyalty>loyalty</hint> is below 50, there is a chance of betrayal on the battlefield.

This means that when they commands an army, he may switch sides to join the enemy, along with his warriors.

The chance of betrayal depends on the loyalty value, the balance of power on the battlefield, and your lord's relationships with the lords of the noble family."
hint_escape,"Departure
If your lord's <hint=hint_loyalty>loyalty</hint> is below 25, there is a chance of their departure from your settlement.

If they are the heir to the throne, they may lead a rebellion, and if they are a common lord, they may switch to another noble family."
hint_riot,"Rebellion
The character departs with some of your unhappy warriors to the camp of forest bandits.

With the support of noble families hostile to you, the rebel army can grow significantly.

After some time, the rebels will attempt to attack your city."
hint_slave_riot,"Prisoner Uprising
Each day that the average <hint=hint_slave_happines>mood</hint> of the prisoner population is below <red>25</red> (meaning they are unhappy), there is a chance that they will start an uprising.

<hint=hint_persons_slave>Prisoners</hint> will organize themselves into a rebel group that will attempt to burn down the settlement and destroy your noble family."
hint_warrior_riot,"Warrior Uprising
If the average <hint=hint_mood>mood</hint> of warriors is below 25 (meaning they are unhappy), they may start an uprising.

They will unite into a group and attack the hall with the aim of looting, and then they will leave to join the <hint=hint_persons_forest_bandits>forest bandits</hint>."
hint_pogrom,"Religious Uprising
If the average <hint=hint_mood>mood</hint> of the <hint=hint_persons_fanatic>fanatics</hint> for the day is below <red>25</red> (meaning they are unhappy), they may start an uprising - but first, they will demand you to sacrifice a lord whom they blame for their troubles.

If you refuse them, the fanatics will unite into squads that will:
$ Burn houses and kill everyone they believe to be insufficiently devout.
$ Burn down the <hint=hint_bld_library>Library</hint> and other buildings.
$ Seek out and try to kill the lord they believe to be guilty.

A bishop can also initiate a religious uprising, inciting fanatics against his enemy.

Tips for improving mood:
$ Let freshly recruited grow accustomed to the realities of combat before sending them into battle. A new warrior's fear of death will gradually wear off as they undergo combat training.
$ Choose lords with a high <hint=hint_skill_command>Command</hint> skill to lead your squads.

$ Allocate a separate <hint=hint_bld_temple>Temple</hint> for the warriors and preach faith in it. This will turn them into <hint=hint_persons_fanatic>fanatics</hint> who relish pain. However, this is a dangerous path if you have poor relations with the <hint=hint_bishop>bishop</hint>, as they will be on his side in the event of a <hint=hint_pogrom>religious uprising</hint>.
$ Initiate <hint=hint_nt_terror_culture>terror</hint> against the culture your warriors hate or pursue policies aligned with their cultural values."

hint_cainism,"Cainism
A heretical doctrine from the late era of the <hint=hint_crimson_empire>Crimson Empire</hint>.

While the teachings of Mother Sophia consider her brother Cain as the first murderer and an evil antagonist against her benevolence, Cainists claim instead that Cain was the benevolent god, who stood against Sophia's dominion and perished at her hands while defending humanity from her oppression.

Cainists consider the strength of human will as the primary virtue and reject many of the moral norms of Mother Sophia's teachings.

Originating on the outskirts of the Crimson Empire, Cainism was spread by <hint=hinr_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, who claimed to have received revelations from the dead god Cain and wrote the <hint=hint_secret_book_of_dead>Secret Book of the Dead</hint>. As a result of the subsequent War of Sacred Flame, Cainism was destroyed, and Michael was exiled, after which his trail was lost.

However, the empire could not withstand the forty years of devastating religious war, and it disintegrated into numerous <hint=hint_new_kingdoms>New Kingdoms</hint> ruled by <hint=hint_noble_house>noble houses</hint>. This is the state in which Norland finds itself today."
hint_secret_book_of_dead,"The Secret Book of the Dead
This book, written by <hint=hinr_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, comprises the primary doctrine of Cainism.

It claims that Mother Sophia is an evil goddess who keeps humans enslaved. Her brother Cain once challenged her to free humanity, but she killed him. However, in death, Cain found freedom in the Velvet Darkness, from whence he revealed himself to Michael and instructed him to record his words and reveal them to the people.

The book asserts that the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church of Mother Sophia</hint> controls people with its doctrine of submission and its <hint=hint_sofia_truth>prohibition on stone structures</hint> higher than knee-level. Cainists believe this allows the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint> to be completely invulnerable in Norland's only stone fortress, the <hint=hint_faith_stone>Stone of Faith</hint>, and at any moment, they can annihilate any settlement that falls out of favor, and when the <hint=hint_sofia_great_purification>Great Purification</hint> comes, expedited by the prohibition against independent fortification, the Church holds all the power and preserves those who will continue to support its domination.

Cainists believe the only way to end the <hint=hint_great_cycle>Great Cycle</hint> is by rebelling against Mother Sophia."
hint_dead_god_herecy,"The Heresy of the Dead God
The later teachings of <hint=hint_prophet_michail>the prophet Michael</hint>, which were adapted for the pagan tribes of the northern forests and develops his cult to an extreme form. It is the religion adhered to by <hint=hint_unholy_horde>the Unholy Horde</hint>.

This contradicts traditional Cainism, as it preaches the very death of civilization that Cainism sought to prevent.

According to the doctrine, the Velvet Darkness into which Cain fell after his death at the hand of Mother Sophia is a space of tranquility and will, the only place beyond the control of this rigid goddess. To be free from the endless cycles of rebirth in this world of suffering, the human soul must go there.

This can be done by calling upon the Dead God Cain at the moment of death. Thus, proper death is seen as a gift of liberation to be sought. 

Adepts of this cult practice human sacrifice and ritual suicide. The ""proper"" killing of infidels is considered a special virtue, as it signifies the salvation of the soul from under the power of Sophia. The men and women of the Horde are all strong warriors trained from childhood who are not afraid to die. This makes the raids of the Unholy Horde, which are religious feats for the cultists, especially dangerous.

During their raids, they not only kill everyone and burn cities but also make a special effort to destroy books that they consider abominations, which they believe the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church</hint> uses to control people.

hint_crimson_empire,"Crimson Empire
Once developing from a small colony of <hint=hint_culture_tanaya>Tanaya</hint> in the west, the Crimson Empire, thanks to innovations in military and bureaucratic affairs obtained from <hint=hint_culture_makha>Makha</hint>, eventually swallowed up half of Norland, displacing the indigenous inhabitants of the central plains - <hint=hint_culture_voruns>Varns</hint> - and putting another local people, the <hint=hint_culture_gwelts>Kaiden</hint>, into its service.

Shortly after rapid expansion came the Golden Age, whose balance remained constant: the empire is ruled by <hint=hint_culture_tanaya>Tanaya</hint>, the few Makha engage in culture and philosophy in their old semi-independent cities, the <hint=hint_culture_gwelts>Kaiden</hint> live on the border, defending it and earning their living through military service, while the <hint=hint_culture_voruns>Varn</hint> reside in the east, providing food supplies to the growing population through trade.

However, centuries of balance were disrupted by the heresy that sprouted in the Makha cities - <hint=hint_cainism>Cainism</hint> - and the subsequent <hint=hint_fire_war>War of Sacred Flame</hint> marked the end of the unified Empire, giving rise to the so-called <hint=hint_new_kingdoms>New Kingdoms</hint>.

Only thanks to the titanic efforts of the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church of Mother Sophia</hint>, the world did not descend into a prehistoric level, and for many centuries now, a new balance has been maintained, upheld by the Matriarch and the priests of the church."
hint_fire_war,"War of Sacred Flame
A war between the Church of Mother Sophia and the heretical Cainite sect that took place from 2652 to 2692.

The Church and the Emperor turned a blind eye to the <hint=hint_cainism>Cainite heresy</hint> for a long time after it first emerged in the cities of the <hint=hint_culture_makha>Makha</hint>. But after several years of aggressive preaching, when riots and arson of Holy Sophia temples began throughout the west, the empire responded with repression, and the heretical cities rebelled in kind, inciting a vast war between the two sects.

The war went on with varying success until 2691, when the emperor Maximilian died in battle, leaving no heirs. The empire was on the brink of complete chaos and destruction when the <hint=hint_ieremia>Matriarch Jadwiga</hint> ascended to the Crimson Throne. Seeking an end to the war, she promised amnesty and independence to the rebellious provinces in exchange for access to their cities by the Holy Inquisition and proposed a new structure for the region's monarchies. The heretics agreed, and the <hint=hint_chartia_humility>Charter of Humility</hint> was signed, laying the foundation for the modern structure of the world. The charter set a limit on the amount of noble titles each kingdom would have access to.

As for the heretics, some of them went to the Impassable Mountains in the south, where over time, they degenerated into the tribes of <hint=hint_person_maroders>marauders</hint>, while others, along with the prophet Michael, retreated to the wild north forest and eventually disappeared."

hinr_prophet_michail,"Prophet Michael
Of <hint=hint_culture_makha>Makha</hint> origin, the prophet Michael was born when the <hint=hint_fire_war>War of Sacred Flame</hint> had been raging for 20 years. He made a brilliant career in the imperial church and was involved in the development of the <hint=hint_sofia_truth>Testimony of Truth</hint>, which laid the foundation for fanatical dogmatism and the Inquisition.

In 2685, Michael was sent to one of the rebellious cities of the <hint=hint_cainism>Cainites</hint> with a mission to create a secret society of fanatics for the <hint=hint_sofia_cult>Church of Mother Sophia</hint>.

After several years, the mission was deemed unsuccessful, but instead of returning to the fold of the Loving Family, Michael himself converted to Cainism and soon became its leader, becoming a key figure in the war against the Church.

In 2691, his heretical forces defeated Emperor Maximilian in the Battle of the Great Stone, forcing <hint=hint_synode>the Loving Family</hint> to flee to the imperial castle, now known as the <hint=hint_faith_stone>Stone of Faith</hint>.

However, after signing the <hint=hint_сhartia_humility>Charter of Humility</hint> in 2692, he was betrayed by his comrades and fled into the northwestern forests, where he disappeared.

Furthermore, the book interprets the logia of Sophia's Revelation to justify holy war against any heresy, laying the foundation for Church <hint=hint_persons_fanatic>fanaticism</hint> and the establishment of the <hint=hint_inqusitors>Inquisition</hint>.

It was written by <hint=hint_ieremia>Matriarch Jadwiga</hint> in the second half of the 27th century, shortly before the conclusion of the <hint=hint_fire_war>War of Sacred Flame</hint>, and served as a stringent response to the radicalism of <hint=hint_cainism>Cainism</hint>."

Production buildings create resources from other resources (for example, <hint=hint_resource_food>Flour</hint> is made from <hint=hint_resource_rye>Rye</hint>).

You can place two types of orders:
$ ""Make X"" - a one-time production order. As soon as the required quantity is produced, the work will stop.
$ ""Do Untill X"" - an automatic order to keep the resource quantity at the specified level. If it falls below the specified amount, the workers will produce the necessary quantity.

In the morning, the peasants will go to the city warehouse for the resources needed for production, work all day, and only at the end of the workday (at 6 PM) will they bring the produced goods to your warehouse."

Thus, there will be a 50% (10:10) chance that the attack will hit the target and the defender will receive a cut. Heavy armor adds a packet of 30 ""attack blocked"" tickets to the bag, so the chance of a cut in this case will be significantly lower.

hint_tutorial_fertility,"Soil Fertility
Initially, the map on which your city is located is in ecological balance. However, cutting down trees to less than {fertility_threshold}% of their original number leads to a decrease in soil fertility, as trees protect the soil from erosion.

The forest has the ability to regenerate - new trees appear next to others, thus the larger the forest area, the faster it will recover.

However, as your city grows, you will have to make a choice between the fertility of the fields and intensive logging, compensating for the lack of another resource through external trade.

When your state reaches the size of 12 provinces, you can declare your king as the emperor.

<img=hint_tutorial_emperor></img>

To do this, select the Coronation of the Emperor in your king's menu. This action will challenge the <hint=hint_synode>Loving Family</hint>, and within a few days, you can expect a squad of <hint=hint_inqusitors>Inquisitors</hint> to attempt to burn your province to the ground.

Additionally, after the ceremony, all your subjects will experience a strong negative thought due to fear of the church. However, some population groups will be better protected from this effect:
$ <hint=hint_persons_agnostic>Agnostics</hint> do not strongly believe in Sophia, and their negative thought will be only half as strong as normal.
$ <hint=hint_loyalist>Loyalists</hint> blindly believe in the new Emperor, so their fear will be five times weaker.
$ <hint=hint_persons_fanatic>Fanatics</hint>, provided the king received a blessing, will consider him the new prophet and even gain a positive thought.
$ <hint=hint_addict>Nectar-dependents</hint> are less susceptible to such thoughts, as the pleasure derived from Nectar outweighs their sense of fear.

This is the final challenge in the game, after which there is no return. You will either defeat the punitive squad of Inquisitors and win the game, or you will lose. In any case, the game will end."
hint_tutorial_knight,"Knights
[hint_knight]"
hint_tutorial_two_squads,"Composite Squads
You can send two or more squads at once to attack a target on the world map.

<img=hint_tutorial_two_squads></img>

To do this, create the squads and check the ones you want to send before dispatching.

These squads will travel together and participate in the battle as separate units. This way, the second squad can attack the enemy archers while your first squad fights the infantry.

<b>Hint:</b> To avoid risking your lords, hire <hint=hint_knight>knights</hint> in the Army menu."
hint_tutorial_inspiration,"Inspiration
If a lord wakes up in a happy mood (above 80%), there is a {chance}% chance that they will gain the state of Inspiration (wing icon).

<img=hint_inspiration></img>

In this state, all skills are greatly increased, making it an ideal time to use the lord for activities such as trade negotiations or combat actions.

Inspiration lasts for one day and disappears when the character goes to sleep. It can also vanish if the character's mood becomes unhappy."
hint_tutorial_in_state,"Part of the State
Sometimes when you need to gather strength and there are strong enemies nearby, it makes sense not to create your own State but to join an existing one.

<img=hint_tutorial_in_state></img>

$ You can request to join the Free Cities Alliance through the main province action menu (icon with wings). Within the alliance, you will ensure your protection, increase <hint=hint_market_volume>local demand</hint>, and be able to trade with its members. The only obligation is to maintain good relations with the head of the alliance and to send troops when another member needs protection.
$ When you are coerced into vassalage, it makes sense to consider your options. You will pay tribute to your suzerain, but you can save on your army, as your suzerain will have to protect you. Besides, <hint=hint_market_volume>local demand</hint> will also increase (however, there is no free trade option within vassal kingdoms).

Of course, being part of another State takes you further from the ultimate goal of the game—to unite the provinces of Norland and become Emperor. But in certain situations, this option can be a lifesaver and a necessary respite."
hint_tutorial_hunt,"Hunting
To improve relationships, you can ask lords to spend time together. However, if a lord's <hint=hint_skill_manners>Manners</hint> are lacking, a joint hunt might be the better option.

<img=hint_tutorial_hunt></img>

$ During the hunt, two lords will find and attack a <hint=hint_fleshwolf>fleshwolf</hint>. This carries the risk of injury, but you will get some excellent <hint=hint_resource_meat>Meat</hint>.
$ The mutual positive thought after the hunt is strong and long-lasting. Additionally, after the fleshwolf is defeated, the hunters will have a <hint=hint_conversation>deep conversation</hint> - not always pleasant.
$ Hunting is a good tool to build relationships on the world map. You can send any of your lords to hunt with any lord living in another city - for example, to win the favor of a merchant lord or the king's spouse, whose opinion also matters."
hint_tutorial_orders,"Direct Orders
By clicking on the icon in the to-do list at the top of the character menu, you can command the lord to immediately undertake a necessary task.

<img=hint_tutorial_orders></img>

Usually, lords decide for themselves when to do what, but sometimes you can order him to attend to a task immediately if there is an urgent need.

$ At the beginning of the to-do list, the tasks you assigned to him are displayed.
$ When a lord's need starts to bother him, tasks to address these needs also appear there. Click on the icon to make him drop everything and go fulfill that need."
hint_tutorial_pass_crown,"Passing the Crown
When your ruler has too many enemies, you can always pass the crown to someone else.

<img=hint_tutorial_pass_crown></img>

Since relations with neighbors and the matriarch are personal relationships with your monarch, you can reset them by passing the crown.

This will cause significant friction between the former and new ruler, but all external relations will now be established from scratch."
hint_tutorial_relations_tab,"Relations Tab
To see what characters think of each other, go to the relations tab in the character menu.

<img=hint_tutorial_relations_tab></img>

$ Hover over any character's portrait to see which <hint=hint_thought_social>social thoughts</hint> contribute to their <hint=hint_relations>relationship</hint> with them.
$ Factors influencing <hint=hint_interest>interest</hint> are also described there.
$ At the top, there are relationship filters - for example, you can view relationships with characters from other noble houses or relationships between kings.
$ You can also see relationships with important characters by hovering over their portrait on the main tab."
hint_tutorial_hate,"Hate
When one character’s relationship with another falls below <red>-25</red>, they start to feel hatred. This may end in murder, leaving you with one corpse and one criminal hated by the entire family.

<img=hint_tutorial_hate></img>

$ <hint=hint_tutorial_relations_tab>Check the social thoughts</hint> that led to the hatred. For instance, if one lord envies another for having many <hint=hint_resource_rune>Holy Rings</hint>, you can reward the first one or take away some rings from the other to reduce the difference.
$ If you can catch this lord in a good mood, use that moment to invite them to spend time or go hunting with their rival. If one of them is not too angry with the other, they might reconcile.
$ Try scheduling lessons for them. The student will gradually improve their attitude towards the teacher.
$ In extreme cases, you can arrange a <hint=hint_duel>duel</hint>. Duels can result in the death of either combatant, but even if both lords survive, the desire to kill will be removed when the duel is over.
$ And in case your lord is hated by the <hint=hint_bishop>Bishop</hint>, the lord can always <b>beg for forgiveness</b>."

We can resolve this by producing higher-quality products, but we can't do that without specialized knowledge contained in books. But where can we get them?

Dahamat is an ancient fertility goddess of the Makha people, who was displaced by the cult of Mother Sophia during early imperial times.

Although the sacred groves and ancient altars of Dahamat were desecrated and replaced by temples of Mother Sophia, the priests of Dahamat were not completely eradicated. They transformed their cult into a secret, highly exclusive society. While Mother Sophia inherited many traits of the old Dahamat, the later cult of the old goddess took on more sinister features, allowing its followers to survive until recent times.

The cult priests, in particular, possess the ability to secretly kill anyone, whether a lord or King, anywhere in Norland. Ignorant rumors attribute a supernatural nature to this skill, while more enlightened lords speak of their centuries-honed acting skills. They mimic anyone, mastering accents, gestures, and clothing, enabling the cult’s assassins to infiltrate the most secure places and use an ancient poison that leaves no trace.

Cult priests often visit cities, offering their services in exchange for the firstborns of noble Kings, who are then raised in their religion.

The actual whereabouts of the Dahamat priests remain a mystery, despite the Holy Inquisition's interest, possibly due to some Kings' reluctance to engage in conflict with the cult."

All the residents of your city have their own <b>thoughts</b>, which together determine their <b>mood</b>.

$ Select a lord by clicking on their portrait to see their thoughts.
"
adv_tutorial_2.obj_king_needs_2_new,"Character Mood

If a lord's <b>mood</b> drops due to <b>negative thoughts</b>, they will start speaking harshly, leading to conflicts. If the situation does not improve, over time, this may result in a nervous breakdown. 

A good mood, on the other hand, can inspire the lord, enhance their skills, and make them more friendly.
"
adv_tutorial_2.obj_king_needs_3_new,"Character Mood

The most basic causes of negative thoughts are the lack of food and shelter, while the simplest way to improve their mood is alcohol.

To do this, let's learn how to construct and manage buildings, starting with builder management.

In Norland, you only control the lordly family, while workers need their instructions to start working.

1. Select the Hall  
2. Click the ""INSTRUCTIONS"" button in the building menu <b>at the bottom left</b>

By fulfilling the peasants' needs, you increase their average mood, which affects <b>migration</b>. An average mood <b>above 50</b> will attract new workers to your city. Conversely, if the average mood falls <b>below 25</b>, peasants will leave and turn to crime.  

There are many ways to boost mood, such as alcohol, temple sermons, and executions, but often the simplest way is to eliminate negative thoughts.  

Let's find out what bothers them the most.

<b>Access</b>
$ Workers take resources from the warehouse for production in the morning and bring finished goods here in the evening. They also receive resources distributed to them through the <hint=hint_finance_menu>Economy Menu</hint>.  
$ Through any warehouse, characters have access to all resources except <hint=hint_resource_gold>Gold</hint> (which is stored in the <hint=hint_bld_castle>Hall</hint>).  

<b>Capacity</b>
$ Resources in the game are grouped into categories (e.g., Rutabaga, Flour, and Meat are Food).  
$ Resources are evenly distributed among warehouses, so each new warehouse increases the total capacity for these categories.  
$ Initially, all resources are stored in the Hall’s warehouse, which has limited capacity.  

<b>Spoilage</b>
$ If resources exceed the total capacity, they begin to spoil at a rate of {spoil_general}% per day.  
$ Food and Herbs spoil even when stored in warehouses (at a rate of {food_general}%), but this process can be slowed by building Granary."

hint_iternal_trade,"Internal Trade
Peasants and warriors often possess <hint=hint_resource_gold>Gold</hint>, which they bring with them or acquire through other means. You can see this by hovering over the peasant and warrior icons in the top left corner.

If you do not provide them with enough food and alcohol, characters will start purchasing these goods from the Caravan. If they accumulate more Gold than {rich_treshold}, they begin to feel wealthy enough to afford luxury goods like <hint=hint_resource_ale>Ale</hint>, <hint=hint_resource_meat>Meat</hint>, and other premium products.

Using internal trade allows you to sell goods and earn Gold from the characters' pockets instead of it going to caravans.

To do this, build <hint=hint_bld_market>Markets</hint> and <hint=hint_bld_tavern>Taverns</hint>, and assign goods and prices for sale in the right section of the <hint=hint_finance_menu>Economy Menu</hint>."
