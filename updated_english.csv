""What happened, {soul_uuid_brother}? Do not delay, tell me the truth.""
Unable to look the king in the eyes, {soul_uuid_brother} stuttered as he began to speak:
""Bandits attacked us last night. We tried to defend ourselves, but there were too many of them. They have kidnapped your wife and now they demand a ransom.""
""Then command a messenger to deliver whatever they ask for!""
""But, my king, we are surrounded by enemies. While we are under vassalage's protection for now, you know that the old king's time is running short. If we do not have enough gold and resources, we won't be able to withstand. We need an army.""

Technologies and knowledge are not yet lost, but if nothing is done, they will soon disappear, and with them, civilization will vanish.

There is always hope, but for that, you must:
